        <h2>What is the problem</h2>

            <p>
                Let's try to find an apartment in New York City. What are we going to do.

                1. Find the area where to find the apartment<br/>
                2. Search for the apartment in CraigsList, hotpads, Trulia, Zillow, rent.com, apartment.com<br/>
                3. View the apartments and get an idea how much will it cost<br/>
                4. Visit Neigborhood scout to find if there area is good<br/>
                5. Short List the neigborhood<br/>
                6. Search again for apartments in all these areas<br/>
                7. Check if there are vacancies<br/>
                8. Send the apartments about inquiry<br/>
                9. Schedule a visit
                <br/>

             What if a robot can do all these process and give us a list of ideas based on our income, work location,
                kids school, marital status etc etc...
